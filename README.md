## Project Notes  

- When switching between **desktop** and **mobile views** (or vice versa), a **page refresh is required** to ensure the correct UI is displayed for the respective mode. *(I am aware of this issue and will address it in future updates.)*  
- Run the backend server from the **root directory** using `npm start`.  
- Run the frontend server from the **frontend folder** using `npm run dev`.
